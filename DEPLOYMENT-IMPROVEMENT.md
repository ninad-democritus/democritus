# ✅ Deployment Architecture Improvement

## What Changed

You raised an excellent point about deployment architecture. I've reorganized the Dockerfiles for **true independent deployment**.

## Before (Initial Setup)

```
frontend/
├── Dockerfile.host          ← At root
├── Dockerfile.ingestion     ← At root
├── Dockerfile.ai-canvas     ← At root
└── projects/
    ├── host-shell/
    ├── ingestion-app/
    └── ai-canvas/
```

**Problem**: All Dockerfiles at root makes it less clear which app owns which Dockerfile.

## After (Improved)

```
frontend/
└── projects/
    ├── host-shell/
    │   ├── Dockerfile       ← In app directory ✓
    │   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md    ← Deployment guide ✓
    │   └── nginx.conf
    │
    ├── ingestion-app/
    │   ├── Dockerfile       ← In app directory ✓
    │   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md    ← Deployment guide ✓
    │   └── nginx.conf
    │
    └── ai-canvas/
        ├── Dockerfile       ← In app directory ✓
        ├── DEPLOYMENT.md    ← Deployment guide ✓
        └── nginx.conf
```

**Benefits**: 
- ✅ Clear ownership per app
- ✅ Self-contained deployment config
- ✅ Easy to set up independent CI/CD pipelines
- ✅ Path to splitting into separate repos if needed

## How to Build Each App Independently

### Host Shell

```bash
# From project root
docker build -f frontend/projects/host-shell/Dockerfile -t democritus-host:latest ./frontend

# From frontend directory
cd frontend
docker build -f projects/host-shell/Dockerfile -t democritus-host:latest .
```

### Ingestion App

```bash
# From project root
docker build -f frontend/projects/ingestion-app/Dockerfile -t democritus-ingestion:latest ./frontend

# From frontend directory
cd frontend
docker build -f projects/ingestion-app/Dockerfile -t democritus-ingestion:latest .
```

### AI Canvas

```bash
# From project root
docker build -f frontend/projects/ai-canvas/Dockerfile -t democritus-ai-canvas:latest ./frontend

# From frontend directory
cd frontend
docker build -f projects/ai-canvas/Dockerfile -t democritus-ai-canvas:latest .
```

## Docker Compose Still Works

The `docker-compose.yml` has been updated to reference the new locations:

```yaml
frontend-host:
  build:
    context: ./frontend
    dockerfile: projects/host-shell/Dockerfile  # ← Updated path
  ports:
    - "4200:80"

frontend-ingestion:
  build:
    context: ./frontend
    dockerfile: projects/ingestion-app/Dockerfile  # ← Updated path
  ports:
    - "4201:80"

frontend-ai-canvas:
  build:
    context: ./frontend
    dockerfile: projects/ai-canvas/Dockerfile  # ← Updated path
  ports:
    - "4202:80"
```

Run as before:
```bash
docker compose up frontend-host frontend-ingestion frontend-ai-canvas
```

## CI/CD Pipeline Examples

### GitHub Actions - Separate Workflows

Create three workflow files:

**`.github/workflows/deploy-host.yml`**
```yaml
name: Deploy Host Shell

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'frontend/projects/host-shell/**'
      - 'frontend/libs/ui-kit/**'

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Build
        run: |
          docker build \
            -f frontend/projects/host-shell/Dockerfile \
            -t your-registry/democritus-host:${{ github.sha }} \
            ./frontend
      
      - name: Deploy
        run: |
          # Your deployment commands
```

**`.github/workflows/deploy-ingestion.yml`**
```yaml
name: Deploy Ingestion App

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'frontend/projects/ingestion-app/**'
      - 'frontend/libs/ui-kit/**'

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Build
        run: |
          docker build \
            -f frontend/projects/ingestion-app/Dockerfile \
            -t your-registry/democritus-ingestion:${{ github.sha }} \
            ./frontend
      
      - name: Deploy
        run: |
          # Your deployment commands
```

**`.github/workflows/deploy-ai-canvas.yml`**
```yaml
name: Deploy AI Canvas

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'frontend/projects/ai-canvas/**'
      - 'frontend/libs/ui-kit/**'

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Build
        run: |
          docker build \
            -f frontend/projects/ai-canvas/Dockerfile \
            -t your-registry/democritus-ai-canvas:${{ github.sha }} \
            ./frontend
      
      - name: Deploy
        run: |
          # Your deployment commands
```

### Trigger Behavior

- **Change only ingestion-app**: Only ingestion pipeline runs ✓
- **Change only ai-canvas**: Only ai-canvas pipeline runs ✓
- **Change ui-kit**: All three pipelines run (shared dependency) ✓
- **Change host-shell**: Only host pipeline runs ✓

## Per-App Documentation

  - How to build host-shell independently
  - Environment configuration
  - CI/CD examples
  - Monitoring and rollback

- **`frontend/projects/ingestion-app/DEPLOYMENT.md`**
  - How to build ingestion-app independently
  - CORS configuration
  - remoteEntry.js verification
  - Update process

- **`frontend/projects/ai-canvas/DEPLOYMENT.md`**
  - How to build ai-canvas independently
  - Feature development guide

  - Deployment considerations

## Architecture Documentation

**`frontend/DEPLOYMENT-ARCHITECTURE.md`**
- Complete deployment architecture guide
- CI/CD pipeline examples (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Kubernetes deployment configs
- Best practices
- Deployment scenarios

## Real-World Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Update Ingestion App Only

```bash
# Developer commits to ingestion-app
git push origin main

# CI/CD:
# ✓ Builds ingestion-app Docker image
# ✓ Deploys ingestion-app to production
# ✗ Host shell NOT rebuilt
# ✗ AI Canvas NOT rebuilt

# Result: Fast, independent deployment
```

### Scenario 2: Canary Deployment

```bash
# Deploy new version to 10% of users
docker build -f frontend/projects/ingestion-app/Dockerfile -t registry/ingestion:v2 ./frontend

# Deploy canary
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingestion-canary.yaml

# Monitor metrics
# Rollout to 100% or rollback based on metrics
```

### Scenario 3: Different Versions in Different Environments

```bash
# Dev environment
docker build -f frontend/projects/ingestion-app/Dockerfile -t registry/ingestion:dev ./frontend

# Staging environment
docker build -f frontend/projects/ingestion-app/Dockerfile -t registry/ingestion:staging ./frontend

# Production environment
docker build -f frontend/projects/ingestion-app/Dockerfile -t registry/ingestion:v1.2.3 ./frontend
```

## Key Benefits for Long-Term Deployment

### 1. **Independent Release Cycles**
Each app can be released on its own schedule without affecting others.

### 2. **Team Ownership**
Different teams can own different apps with clear boundaries.

### 3. **Selective Deployments**
Deploy only what changed, reducing deployment time and risk.

### 4. **Easy Rollbacks**
Roll back individual apps without affecting the entire system.

### 5. **Path to Polyrepo**
If needed later, easy to extract each app into its own repository.

### 6. **CI/CD Optimization**
Build and deploy only what changed, saving CI/CD minutes and costs.

## Summary

✅ **Dockerfiles moved to app directories** - Clear ownership
✅ **docker-compose.yml updated** - Still works seamlessly  
✅ **Per-app deployment guides created** - Full documentation
✅ **CI/CD examples provided** - GitHub Actions & GitLab CI
✅ **Independent deployment ready** - True MFE architecture

Your deployment architecture is now optimized for:
- Independent app deployments
- Separate CI/CD pipelines
- Team ownership and autonomy
- Long-term scalability

**Ready for production deployment! 🚀**
